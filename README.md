Wiki: A cartogram is a map in which the geometry of regions is distorted in order to convey the information of an alternate variable such as population. The region area will be inflated or deflated according to its numeric value

This data I took from the UN Population Division and you can access that data and visualize it for other countries on our map here. https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/UN-population-projection-medium-variant?year=2018
The 2018 data is a future projection that the UN Population Division created last year.
Other data â€“ the US in 1776, the population of various metropolitan areas, and the population of some small countries â€“ are mostly from Wikipedia.
